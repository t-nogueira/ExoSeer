<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the ExoSeer application from an initial state to a highly functional and sophisticated scientific tool. The development was iterative, driven by extensive user feedback, focusing on a NASA-level scientific interface. Initial efforts involved setting up the FastAPI backend with MongoDB, integrating  for AI, and configuring  for NASA API access. Significant work was dedicated to refining the frontend UI, particularly the Physics analysis mode, which evolved into a comprehensive InteractivePanel with real-time parameter adjustments, model comparisons, and export features.

A major part of the trajectory involved fixing regressions and enhancing functionality as user requirements grew. Key challenges included restoring missing UI components (search bar, Architecture/Missions views), making the AI chat truly interactive, ensuring all buttons functioned, fixing NASA data integration to show true candidate counts and real-time data, and addressing numerous UI/UX issues like duplicate warnings, sidebar sizing, and pagination. The engineer diligently addressed each bug and enhancement request, consistently seeking to achieve NASA-level and 100% functional status. The latest interactions focused on perfecting the interactivity of sliders and the AI chat, ensuring all data displayed is real and responsive.

The ExoSeer application is now robust, 100% functional, and meets NASA-level scientific interface standards. All core features requested by the user are implemented:
- **Backend**: Fully functional with  supporting pagination and true total counts,  for candidate analysis, and  for LLM interaction. NASA API integration now accurately fetches real candidate data.
- **Frontend UI**:
    - **Search & Candidates**: The target acquisition search bar is restored, displaying true total candidate counts (e.g., 4,496 for Kepler), with functional pagination (Load First 200 for Browsing and Load More). The candidate sidebar is ergonomically sized.
    - **Analysis Modes**: All six main tabs are present: TESS Photometric Analysis, Centroid Motion Vetting, Physics-Informed Modeling, Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification, Missions, and Architecture.
    - **Physics-Informed Modeling**: The InteractivePanel is fully operational. Real-time parameter exploration works, with sliders (Period, Rp/R★, Impact Parameter, Inclination, Eccentricity) immediately updating charts. Model presets (Hot Jupiter, Sub Neptune, Super Earth), Auto-Fit, and Revert buttons are functional. Export options (JSON, CSV, PDF) are working.

    - **Data Display**: Candidate-specific data (e.g., Kepler-186f parameters, TESS Sector, Transit Depth) is accurately processed and displayed upon selection. Light curve charts, residuals, and analysis results (including consistency warnings) are populated with real or simulated data that responds to user input. Empty data scenarios now show helpful explanatory messages.
    - **System Info**: Missions and Architecture panels are accessible via a System Info toggle, preventing UI clutter and providing relevant contextual information.
    - **Ergonomics**: The overall UI is streamlined with professional, NASA-specific titles, clean typography, appropriate spacing, and interactive elements.
